# integradorArquitecturas

## About
**Students** is a system developed by a group of UNICEN (Universidad Nacional del Centro) students for the "Arquitecturas Web" class.
[Universidad Nacional del Centro](https://exa.unicen.edu.ar/)

## Requeriments
- Create "bataman" database with **utf8mb4_general_ci** encoding
- MAVEN as dependency manager. [Docs Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- MySQL 8.0.30 integrated into maven. [MySql Connector](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.30)

## Docker 
**Students** comes with a Dockerfile that allows running in containers in combination with an external MySQL database. Note: It is highly recommended to use an external database for production use, as the standalone image does not take care of data persistence.

`docker-compose up`
